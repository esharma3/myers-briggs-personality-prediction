    - api_field: scope
      arg_name: scope
      help_text: |
        The search is limited to the resources within the `scope`. The allowed value must be one of
        the following:
          * Organization number (i.e. "organizations/123")
          * Folder number(i.e. "folders/1234")
          * Project number (i.e. "projects/12345")
        If not specified, it will use your configured project in `$ gcloud config list project`. You
        can change this setting by running `$ gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`.
    - api_field: assetTypes
      arg_name: asset-types
      help_text: |
        A list of asset types (i.e., "compute.googleapis.com/Disk") to search of. If specified and
        non-empty, only resources matching the specified types will be returned. If empty, it will
        search all the supported asset types. See
        https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview for supported
        asset types.
    - api_field: pageSize

      help_text: |
        The page size for search result pagination. The number of matching results may be fewer than
        requested based on the query. The maximum page size is 2000. If page-size is not given the
        backend will pick an appropriate default page size.
    - api_field: pageToken
      arg_name: page-token
      help_text: |
        If present, retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call to this method.
        `page_token` must be the value of `next_page_token` from the previous response. The values
        of all other method parameters must be identical to those in the previous call.
