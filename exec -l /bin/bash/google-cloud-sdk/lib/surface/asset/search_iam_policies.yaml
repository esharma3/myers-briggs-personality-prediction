        Examples:
          * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that contain amy@mycompany.com:
            ```policy : "amy@mydomain.com"```
          * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that contain the Owner role:
            ```policy : "roles/owner"```
          * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that have myuser@mycompany.com
            in the Owner role:
            ```policy : ("roles/owner" "myuser@mycompany.com")```
          * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that have myuser@mycompany.com in
            the Owner role or youruser@mycompany.com in the Viewer role:
            ```policy : (("roles/owner" "myuser@mycompany.com") OR ("roles/viewer" "youruser@mycompany.com"))```
          * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings that are set on a resource:
            ```resource : "projects/123"```
          * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings that are set on resources whose names contain substring
            "proj":
            ```resource : "*proj*"```

      arg_name: scope
      help_text: |
        The search is limited to the IAM policies within the `scope`. The allowed value must be one
        of the following:
          * Organization number (i.e. "organizations/123")
          * Folder number(i.e. "folders/1234")
          * Project number (i.e. "projects/12345")
        If not specified, it will use your configured project in `$ gcloud config list project`. You
        can change this setting by running `$ gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`.
    - api_field: pageSize
      arg_name: page-size
      help_text: |
        The page size for search result pagination. The number of matching results may be fewer than
        requested based on the query. The maximum page size is 2000. If page-size is not given the
        back end will pick an appropriate default page size.
    - api_field: pageToken
      arg_name: page-token
      help_text: |
        If present, retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call to this method.
        `page_token` must be the value of `next_page_token` from the previous response. The values
        of all other method parameters must be identical to those in the previous call.
