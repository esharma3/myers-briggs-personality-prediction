    items:
      type: string
  authentication:
    description: |-
      A URL referring to a networksecurity.Authentication resource that
      describes how the proxy should authenticate inbound traffic. If left
      blank, communications between services are not encrypted (i.e., the TLS
      policy is set to OPEN). When terminating inbound traffic to this proxy,
      the TerminationTls setting of Authentication.TransportAuthentication is
      applied. Refer to the Authentication and
      Authentication.TransportAuthentication.TerminationTls resources for
      additional details. authentication only applies to a global
      TargetHttpsProxy attached to globalForwardingRules with the
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    type: string
  authorization:
    description: |-
      A URL referring to a networksecurity.Authorization resource that describes
      how the proxy should authorize inbound traffic. If left blank, access will
      not be restricted by an authorization policy. Refer to the Authorization
      resource for additional details. authorization only applies to a global
      TargetHttpsProxy attached to globalForwardingRules with the
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    type: string
  certificateMap:
    description: |-
      URL of a certificate map that identifies a certificate map associated with
      the given target proxy. This field can only be set for global target
      proxies. If set, sslCertificates will be ignored.
    type: string
  creationTimestamp:
    description: '[Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.'
    type: string
  description:
    description: |-
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
    type: string
  kind:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetHttpsProxy for target
      HTTPS proxies.
    type: string
  name:
    description: |-
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created.
      The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
      lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a
      dash.
    type: string
  proxyBind:
    description: |-
      This field only applies when the loadBalancingScheme is
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. When set to true the Envoy binds on the IP address
      specified by the forwarding rule. Default is false.
    type: boolean
  quicOverride:
    description: |-
      Specifies the QUIC override policy for this TargetHttpsProxy resource.
      This setting determines whether the load balancer attempts to negotiate
      QUIC with clients. You can specify NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE. - When quic-
      override is set to NONE, Google manages whether QUIC is used.  - When
      quic-override is set to ENABLE, the load balancer uses QUIC when possible.
      - When quic-override is set to DISABLE, the load balancer doesn't use
      QUIC.  - If the quic-override flag is not specified, NONE is implied. -
    type: string
    enum:
    - DISABLE
    - ENABLE
    - NONE
  region:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional TargetHttpsProxy
      resides. This field is not applicable to global TargetHttpsProxies.
    type: string
  selfLink:
    description: '[Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.'
    type: string
  selfLinkWithId:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with the resource id.
    type: string
  sslCertificates:
    description: |-
      URLs to SslCertificate resources that are used to authenticate connections
      between users and the load balancer. At least one SSL certificate must be
      specified. Currently, you may specify up to 15 SSL certificates.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  sslPolicy:
    description: |-
      URL of SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the
      TargetHttpsProxy resource. If not set, the TargetHttpsProxy resource
      has no SSL policy configured.
    type: string
  urlMap:
    description: |-
      A fully-qualified or valid partial URL to the UrlMap resource that
      defines the mapping from URL to the BackendService. For example, the
      following are all valid URLs for specifying a URL map:   -
      https://www.googleapis.compute/v1/projects/project/global/urlMaps/url-
      map  - projects/project/global/urlMaps/url-map  - global/urlMaps/url-
      map
