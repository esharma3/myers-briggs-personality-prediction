      type: string
  authentication:
    description: |-
      This field specifies the URL of authentication resource to apply
      authentication config to inbound traffic for the matched
      endpoints(Backends). More specifically, terminationTls of
      transportAuthentication is used to determine the authentication config to
      applied to terminate the inbound traffic at the identified backends. Refer
      to Authentication.transportAuthentication.terminationTls. If the
      authentication is applied to a proxy that is fronting the endpoint to
      terminate the traffic on behalf of the endpoint, OriginationTls can be set
      to specify the authentication for traffic from the proxy to the actual
      endpoints. More specifically, the OriginationTls of
      transportAuthentication is applied to the outgoing traffic from the proxy
      to the endpoint. This is typically used for sidecar model where the proxy
      identifies itself as endpoint to the control plane, with the connection
      between sidecar and endpoint requiring authentication. Refer to
      Authentication.transportAuthentication.OriginationTls. If this field is
      not specified, authentication is disabled(open) for this endpoint.
    type: string
  authorization:
    description: |-
      This field specifies the URL of Authorization resource that applies
      authorization policies to the inbound traffic at the matched endpoints.
      Refer to Authorization. If this field is not specified, authorization is
      disabled(no authz checks) for this endpoint.
    type: string
  endpointMatcher:
    description: |-
      A matcher that selects endpoints to which the policies should be applied.
    $ref: EndpointMatcher.yaml
  httpFilters:
    description: HTTP filters configuration for the endpoint.
    $ref: HttpFilters.yaml

    type: string
  trafficPortSelector:
    description: |-
      Port selector for the (matched) endpoints. If no port selector is
      provided, the matched config is applied to all ports.
    $ref: TrafficPortSelector.yaml
  type:
    description: |-
      The type of endpoint config. This is primarily used to validate the
      configuration.
